# The Link Between Fake Reviews and Intellectual Property Infringement: A Data-Driven Investigation

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for detecting fake reviews and analyzing their correlation with intellectual property infringement in e-commerce platforms.

## üéØ Research Objectives

1. **Identify key features** that distinguish fake reviews from genuine ones through linguistic, sentiment, and rating distribution analysis
2. **Analyze correlation** between fake review patterns and counterfeit product listings
3. **Develop predictive framework** to identify high-risk sellers or product categories associated with counterfeiting

## üìä Pipeline Overview

### Core Components

- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced text cleaning, tokenization, and linguistic feature extraction
- **Sentiment Analysis**: VADER + Transformer-based sentiment scoring with emotion detection
- **Fake Review Detection**: Heuristic-based weak supervision using multiple indicators
- **Counterfeit Detection**: Proxy-based identification of IP-infringing products/sellers
- **Feature Engineering**: Comprehensive feature set creation with interaction terms
- **Machine Learning**: Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Statistical analysis of fake review-counterfeit relationships
- **Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and comprehensive plots

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and customize for specific datasets
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Built-in synthetic dataset for testing and demonstration
- **Multiple ML Models**: Comparison of different classification approaches
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP values and feature importance analysis
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple metrics and statistical significance testing

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fake-reviews-ip-infringement
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download spaCy English model:
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Basic Usage

#### Option 1: Use the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook fake_reviews_ip_infringement_pipeline.ipynb
```

#### Option 2: Use the Python Module
```python
from fake_review_detection import run_complete_pipeline

# Run with synthetic data for demonstration
results = run_complete_pipeline(use_synthetic_data=True)

# Or use your own dataset
import pandas as pd
your_data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
results = run_complete_pipeline(df=your_data, use_synthetic_data=False)
```

## üìã Dataset Requirements

Your dataset should include the following columns:

### Required Columns
- `review_text`: Review content (string)
- `rating`: Numerical rating (1-5)
- `timestamp`: Review timestamp (datetime)
- `user_id`: Unique user identifier (string)
- `product_id`: Unique product identifier (string)
- `seller_id`: Unique seller identifier (string)

### Optional Columns
- `verified_purchase`: Boolean indicating verified purchase
- `helpful_votes`: Number of helpful votes received
- `is_fake`: Ground truth labels for fake reviews (if available)
- `is_counterfeit`: Ground truth labels for counterfeit products (if available)

### Example Data Loading
```python
# Replace the load_data() function in the notebook with:
def load_data():
    df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
    df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
    return df
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Fake Review Detection

Modify the `FakeReviewLabeler` class to adjust detection heuristics:

```python
fake_labeler = FakeReviewLabeler()
# Adjust indicator weights
fake_labeler.fake_indicators['short_review_high_rating']['weight'] = 0.5
# Set custom threshold
df_labeled = fake_labeler.label_fake_reviews(df, threshold=0.3)
```

### Customizing Counterfeit Detection

Add your own external indicators:

```python
counterfeit_detector = CounterfeitDetector()
# Add custom indicators before processing
df['custom_indicator'] = your_custom_logic(df)
df_counterfeit = counterfeit_detector.label_counterfeit_products(df)
```

### Model Configuration

Train specific models or adjust hyperparameters:

```python
model_trainer = ModelTrainer()
# Add custom models
model_trainer.models['custom_model'] = YourCustomModel()
results = model_trainer.train_all_models(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
```

## üìö Methodology

### Fake Review Detection Approach
1. **Linguistic Analysis**: Text length, complexity, sentiment patterns
2. **Behavioral Patterns**: Review timing, user history, purchase verification
3. **Content Analysis**: Generic language, excessive emotions, repeated phrases
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Review bursts, suspicious timing patterns

### Counterfeit Detection Approach
1. **Review Pattern Analysis**: High fake review ratios, rating manipulation
2. **Seller Behavior**: New sellers with high volumes, takedown history
3. **External Indicators**: Price analysis, image authenticity, legal actions
4. **Network Analysis**: Cross-product patterns, seller relationships

### Statistical Methods
- **Correlation Analysis**: Multiple correlation measures for robust analysis
- **Feature Selection**: Mutual information and statistical significance
